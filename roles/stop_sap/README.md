# Role stop_sap

The role stop_sap is used to stop one or multiple SAP instances, either for a given SAP System ID (SID) or for all SAP systems that are configured in file /usr/sap/sapservices. The role stop_sap is using the sapcontrol command of the SAP Host Agent as suggested in [SAP Note 1763593](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/1763593). The role stop_sap is using tags to control whether a single instance for a given SID, all local instances for all configured SIDs or the SAP start services for a given SID are being stopped.
